# learning VIM keybindings playing

[VIM Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) is an online game that help learning VIM keybindings

I saw a reference to it in a screencast by Colby CheeZe: [Why VIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6-phM56H-Q&list=PLYp_atXvejjkN8bxs--Z8QL__hCY4KTXG&index=5)

Just keep in mind that just the first two/three levels are free. Access for 6 months to the full adventure costs $25.
