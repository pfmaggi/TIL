# Changes in the naming of Android for Work

## The Announcement
On 2016 December 8th, Google's Adam Connors (Software Engineer) and Travis McCoy (Product Manager) published a blog titled [Update on Android and Google Playâ€™s progress in enterprise](https://blog.google/topics/connected-workspaces/update-android-and-google-plays-progress-enterprise/).  
In this blog, Google outlined the change in branding for Android for Work and Google Play for Work. They will be know simply as __Android__ and __Google Play__.  
The idea is that AfW enterprise capabilities are already at the core of the OS, so, the _for Work_ branding is not required any more.

Together with this announcement, Google's Andrew Toy (Product Management Director for Android) published a second blog: [5 ways Android tackles issues that matter to businesses](https://blog.google/topics/connected-workspaces/5-ways-android-tackles-issues-matter-businesses/) explaining how the Android platform evolved from Lollipop to Nougat to add enterprise class security features like:

  - [Direct Boot and File-based Encryption](https://android-developers.blogspot.it/2016/09/security-enhancements-in-nougat.html)
 
A lot of enfasys is around the [monthly security updates](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/) that Google is currently releases for it's devices and AOSP. Here is important to understand that the Hardware manufacturer needs to be on board.  
On this topic, Zebra is surely top of class.
