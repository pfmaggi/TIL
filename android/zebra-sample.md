# Where are all Zebra's EMDK for Android samples?

## The latest versions
As I'm writing the latest Zebra's EMDK for Android is v6.6, supporting KitKat, Lollipop and Marshmallow devices.  All the documentation is available on [TechDocs](http://techdocs.zebra.com), and from there you can find [all the samples](http://techdocs.zebra.com/emdk-for-android/6-6/samples/) and their source code on GitHub, under the [Zebra organization](https://github.com/Zebra).

Here you can find the latest version of the samples:

* [EMDK v6.6](https://github.com/Zebra/samples-emdkforandroid-6_6/tree/AllSamples)
* [EMDK v6.4](https://github.com/Zebra/samples-emdkforandroid-6_4/tree/AllSamples)
* [EMDK v6.0](https://github.com/Zebra/samples-emdkforandroid-6_0/tree/AllSamples)
* [EMDK v5.0](https://github.com/Zebra/samples-emdkforandroid-5_0/tree/AllSamples)

## The older sample
Sample for older version of Zebra's EMDK for Android are still available on github but under a different organization: [Developer Zebra](https://github.com/developer-zebra).  
Here you can find:

* [EMDK v4.2](https://github.com/developer-zebra/samples-emdkforandroid-4_2/tree/AllSamples)
* [EMDK v4.0](https://github.com/developer-zebra/samples-emdkforandroid-4_0/tree/AllSamples)
* [EMDK v3.1](https://github.com/developer-zebra/samples-emdkforandroid-3_1/tree/AllSamples)

Plus you can find the ADT version of the sample:

* [EMDK v4.0](https://github.com/developer-zebra/samples-emdkforandroid-4_0-ADT/tree/AllSamples)

## A note on the sample
All these sample repositories are build in the same way. The master branch contains only a README file and there's a branch for every sample, **PLUS** a branch with all the sample that is the one that I usually clone using the command:

    git clone -b AllSamples <Repository to clone>
