# Android Support Library archive
I usually find difficult to keep track of which support library versions are available and is quite frustrating when I cannot find the exact number I need for a specific sample that I build months ago.  
To this I can add that Android Studio always complain when I try to use something with a `+` in the version (to avoid to specify the full version)... this has been something bothering for me way too much:

> __Caution:__ Using dynamic dependencies (for example, palette-v7:23.0.+) can cause unexpected version updates and regression incompatibilities.  
> We recommend that you explicitly specify a library version (for example, palette-v7:25.4.0).



At the end I searched and found: [Recent Support Library Revisions](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/revisions.html)

This page provides details about the most recent Support Library package releases. For earlier releases, see the [Support Library Revision Archive](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/rev-archive.html).
