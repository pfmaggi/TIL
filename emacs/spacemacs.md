# SpaceMacs 

## What is SpaceMacs?
[SpaceMacs](http://spacemacs.org/) is an emacs opinionated distribution that provides a `vi` friendly experience.

## So what?
I'm a long time emacs used that tried over time to learn `vi` key-bindings, but emacs muscle memory is too strong!

I've read over and over again about the great SpaceMacs distribution and I finally decided to give it a go.
