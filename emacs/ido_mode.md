## So what?
I use I Do mode since a long time and always had the issue of having to confirm when you want to create a new file, or how to open a directory in `dired`.  
Two little commands help in this case:

   - `C-j` = You write the name of the new filename you want to create and press `C-j` instead of `Enter`. Ka-boom
   - `C-f` = Reverts to the old find-file completion engine. Helpful to open a dired buffer.
