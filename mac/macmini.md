# Upgrading a MacMini 2012

I wrote this long time ago. It was supposed to be a blog post but I never finished it.

Long story short, this summer (2017) I wanted to update the small 128GB SSD I installed in 2014.  For less money I now got a 512GB SSD and this notes has been useful to help me remember hot to take the MacMini apart and back together...

So, it's now a TIL :-)

## New/old mac mini in pieces and back together.

I finally decided to replace my aging 2007 Mac Book White with a new/old Mac Mini.
I was waiting for an update to the Mac Mini since some time and, after the announcement of the new 2014 model I decided that it was finally time to buy a new shiny 2012 Mac Mini ;-)

The new one is a bit of a disappointment regarding lack of upgradability and missing the option of a quad core processor [add a reference](http://pietromaggi.com).

So, I've ordered through Amazon, a quad-core Core i7 MacMini, a couple of memory modules to upgrade it to 16GB of RAM and a nice 128GB SSD, something that I really started to appreciate after having revived my aging 2007 MacBook last year gifting it a SSD. Last piece that I had to bought was the kit to install the SSD as a second drive in the Mac Mini.

After having received everything (as always with a perfect service from Amazon) I used [this OCW video to upgrade the Mac mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63WL3Q7UujI).

So, after dinner, with wife and kids already in bed I started to dismount and remount the Mini and then follow [this instruction to setup the machine](http://blog.macsales.com/15619-special-note-for-adding-an-ssd-to-a-2012-mac-mini).
