# Clone Zebra's EMDK samples

Good thing: Zebra's EMDK are available on github!  
Surprise!: every sample is registered in a different branch in the same repository...

## Took to me some seconds to realize that if I clone the repository there's nothing in it...
This is simply because the master branch is empty. Every sample is in a different branch.

Luckily there's a branch with all samples. So, if you want to retrieve all the samples, you can go on the console and use the command:

    git clone -b AllSamples https://github.com/Zebra/samples-emdkforandroid-6_0.git
